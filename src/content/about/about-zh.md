## Warm welcome to my blog!

It's not important what's my name, what matters is what I am **saying**.

I hope to have a place where I can record some of my `Think`, including but not limited to technology.

Hope you enjoy here.

" Blogs have their own hidden value. Blogging is not for the applause of others, but because of your own needs.

  Blogging clears your mind. It helps you organize your thoughts and sharpen your perspective. When you write,  you think better. When you think better, you produce better results.

  The target readers of the blog are not actually the Internet population, but your future self. Your articles will allow you to see the evolution of your own thoughts.

  In addition, maybe one day in the future, someone who really needs your article will find it. An in-depth article will have a longer lasting impact than a viral article.

  Blogging is a bit like street photography. You walk through the city with your camera in hand. You see a scene - a moment full of light, shadow, and humanity - and you capture it.

  Nobody cares what you photograph. But that's not why you take photos, you take photos because you see something.

  The same is true with blogging. You blog because you are thinking, because you are observing, and because you want to put it somewhere.

  If someone reads it, all the better. If not, the job is still done.

  This is the real point."
